                <h1>Vincent van Gogh</h1>
                <h4>Mar 30, 1853 - Jul 29, 1890</h4>
                <p> Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the
                    most
                    famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks,
                    including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They
                    include
                    landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and
                    dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not
                    commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his
                    suicide at age thirty-seven.
                </p>
                <details>
                    <summary class="more"><span>More</span></summary>
                    <p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and
                        thoughtful. As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed
                        after
                        he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in
                        southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881,
                        having
                        moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the
                        two
                        kept a long correspondence by letter.Vincent van Gogh’s artistic journey was marked by intense
                        passion and a relentless pursuit of self-expression. His works resonate with raw emotion,
                        capturing
                        the essence of the human experience. Van Gogh’s use of color was revolutionary, as he infused
                        his
                        canvases with vibrant yellows, fiery reds, and deep blues. His brushstrokes were bold and
                        impulsive,
                        conveying both turmoil and beauty. Despite facing personal struggles, including mental health
                        challenges and financial hardship, Van Gogh remained committed to his art. His legacy endures,
                        inspiring generations of artists and art enthusiasts worldwide. </p>

                <h3>Self-Portrait, 1889</h3>
                <p>Van Gogh painted many self-portraits during the course of his career, no fewer than 35. The one
                    displayed
                    below, painted in 1889, is one of his most famous. Van Gogh depicted himself wearing what he used to
                    work in – his blue jacket and shirt. In an attempt to be as true to himself as possible, he depicts
                    his
                    sharp features, the furrow in his brow, and the striking red tones of his hair and beard. This is
                    one of
                    the final self-portraits he painted before his death the following year. </p>

                <h3>Starry Night, 1889</h3>
                <p>Van Gogh’s painting Starry Night (1889), is one of his most iconic. Leading up to this point, Van
                    Gogh
                    had been suffering from mental health issues, so much so that it led to him cutting off his left
                    ear.
                    After this incident, in 1888 he was admitted to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in
                    Saint-Rémy-de-Provence to recover. The view that we see in Starry Night is actually inspired by the
                    view
                    that Van Gogh saw from his bedroom in the asylum. The swirling blues of the moonlit night sky have
                    become synonymous with the artist’s style and the emotional quality of his use of color. </p>

                <h3>Sunflowers, 1889</h3>
                <p>During his time in Arles, South of France, in the years 1888-89, Van Gogh created five paintings of
                    sunflowers in a vase, using only shades of yellow and a touch of green. He wrote that for him
                    sunflowers
                    represented “gratitude” and so hung one of them in his home. Later, his friend and fellow artist
                    Paul
                    Gaugin, while living with him for a short while, said that he very much liked the works and asked
                    Van
                    Gogh for one of the paintings, which he was given. Today, this copy sits in the Van Gogh Museum in
                    Amsterdam. </p>
